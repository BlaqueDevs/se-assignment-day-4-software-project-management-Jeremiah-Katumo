## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
It helps in maximizing profits by reducing expenses in the project. Cost-effective development allows for competitive pricing, and better market positioning. It ensures proper resource efficiency.

## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Agile is iterative and incremental while waterfal is linear and sequential. Agile is dynamic and flexible while waterfal can not be altered past the planning phase.
The advantage of agile is that it offers faster time to market as compared to waterfall. The advantage of waterfall over agile is that it offers clear structure and well defined stages.

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each? 
Agile is used in software startups and SaaS development, mobile and web development e.g a social media app with AI recommender system. Waterfall is used in defensive applications, health and medical systems, banking financial systems like implementing a new banking solution which requires clear security protocols, regulatory approvals.

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
1. Regression testing
2. Continuous integration and Continuous development
3. Automated Testing like unit tests and integration tests.
4. Code reviews and peer programming
** It is important to maintain high standards as it reduces costs and rework, boosts development efficiency, prevents business risks.

## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
## 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?
## 11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?
## 12. What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?
## 13. How can understanding market trends inform your softwareâ€™s positioning and development?
